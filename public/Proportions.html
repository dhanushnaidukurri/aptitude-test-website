            <h3>Formulas on Calculating Percentages: </h3>
            <p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li>Definition: Percentages represent a proportion out of 100 and are often used to express ratios, fractions, and proportions in a more accessible format.</li><br>
                    <li>Calculation Methods: There are various methods for calculating percentages, including using the formula: (part/whole) x 100%, and understanding the concept of finding a percentage increase or decrease.</li><br>
                    <li>Practical Applications: Percentages are widely used in finance to calculate interest rates, tax rates, and discounts. They are also employed in fields like statistics to analyze data.</li><br>
                    <li>Real-World Examples: Examples of calculating percentages can include finding the percentage of sales tax on a purchase, determining the percentage increase in a stock's value, or computing the percentage of students who passed an exam.</li><br>
                    <li>Common Mistakes: Common errors when working with percentages include forgetting to convert percentages to decimal form for calculations, misinterpreting percentage changes, and improperly applying percentages to solve problems.</li><br>

            <h3>Formulas on Proportional Relationships:</h3>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Definition: Proportional relationships describe situations where two quantities vary in a consistent ratio, often represented as a fraction.</li><br>
                    <li>Identifying Proportions: In proportional relationships, you can identify proportions by comparing the ratios of the quantities involved, which remain constant.</li><br>
                    <li>Direct and Inverse Proportions: Understand the concepts of direct proportionality (as one quantity increases, the other increases) and inverse proportionality (as one quantity increases, the other decreases).</li><br>
                    <li>Real-World Applications: Proportional relationships can be found in various scenarios, such as speed and distance, cost and quantity, or time and work.</li><br>
                    <li>Graphical Representation: Proportional relationships can be graphically represented as straight lines through the origin for direct proportions and as hyperbolas for inverse proportions.</li><br>
                </ul>

            <h3>Formulas on Percentage Change : </h3>
            <p>
                <ul>
                   <li>Definition: Percentage change refers to the increase or decrease in a quantity compared to its initial value, usually expressed as a percentage.</li><br>
                   <li>Calculating Percentage Change: To find the percentage change, use the formula: [(final value - initial value) / initial value] x 100%.</li><br>
                   <li>Interpretation: Positive percentages represent an increase, while negative percentages represent a decrease.</li><br>
                   <li>Applications: Percentage change is commonly used in economics to measure inflation, stock market performance, and changes in population.</li><br>
                   <li>Relative vs. Absolute Change: Understand the difference between relative change (percentage change) and absolute change (the actual numeric change in value).</li><br>
                </ul>

            <h3>Formulas on Solving Proportion Problems</h3>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Definition: Proportion problems involve finding missing values in a ratio or comparing two ratios to determine if they are equivalent.</li><br>
                    <li>Cross-Multiplication Method: Learn the cross-multiplication technique to solve proportion problems by setting up equal ratios and solving for the missing value</li><br>
                    <li>Real-World Examples: Proportion problems often appear in cooking recipes, mixtures, and similar scenarios where you need to scale quantities.</li><br>
                    <li>Inverse Proportions: Understand how to solve problems involving inverse proportions, where the product of two quantities remains constant</li><br>
                    <li>Checking Solutions: After solving a proportion problem, it's essential to check your solution by confirming that the ratios remain equal.</li><br>
                </ul>

            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Definition: Discounts and markups are applied to the original price of a product to determine the final selling price.</li><br>
                    <li>Discount Calculations: Learn how to calculate discounts, such as percentage discounts or fixed amount discounts.</li><br>
                    <li>Markup Calculations: Understand how to calculate markups, which are often expressed as a percentage of the cost price.</li><br>
                    <li>Sale Prices: Find the final sale price by applying discounts or markups to the original price.</li><br>
                    <li>Comparison Shopping: Knowledge of discounts and markups can help consumers make informed decisions when comparing prices and finding the best deals.</li><br>
