            <h3>Basic Syntax and Data Types</h3>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>C is a case-sensitive language, meaning that variables and function names are distinguished by their capitalization</li><br>
                    <li>Common data types in C include'int'(integers),'float'(floating-point numbers),'char'(characters), and'double'(double-precision floating-point numbers)</li><br>
                    <li>C uses various operators such as +, -, *, /, and % for arithmetic operations, and ==, !=, >,and >= for comparisons</li><br>
                    <li>Statements in C must end with a semicolon (;), and code blocks are defined using curly braces ({ and })</li><br>
                </ul>
            </p>
        </div>
        <div id="Percentages">
            <h3>Control Flow</h3>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Conditional statements like if, else if, and else are used to make decisions in C programs based on certain conditions</li><br>
                    <li>The switch statement allows you to choose from multiple code blocks based on the value of an expression</li><br>
                    <li>Loops such as for, while, and do-while are used for repeating a set of instructions as long as a specific condition is met</li><br>
                    <li>The break statement is used to exit a loop prematurely, and the continue statement skips the current iteration and proceeds to the next one</li><br>
                    <li>Control structures help in creating structured and efficient programs by controlling the flow of execution</li><br>
                </ul>
            </p>
        </div>
        <div id="Ratios">
            <h3>Functions and Modular Programming</h3>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Functions are reusable blocks of code in C, typically defined with a return type, name, and parameter list</li><br>
                    <li>Function prototypes are used to declare a function before its actual definition, allowing functions to be used before their implementation</li><br>
                    <li>Parameters are variables that can be passed to a function, allowing it to accept and work with different values when called</li><br>
                    <li>Modular programming involves breaking down a program into smaller, manageable functions to improve code organization and maintainability</li><br>                
                </ul>
            </p>
        </div>
        <div id="simple">
            <h3>Arrays and Pointers</h3>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Arrays are collections of elements of the same data type and are declared using square brackets (e.g., int myArray[5])</li><br>
                    <li>Arrays in C are zero-based, meaning the first element is accessed using index 0</li><br>
                    <li>Pointers are variables that store memory addresses, and they are used to work with arrays, dynamic memory allocation, and other low-level operations</li><br>
                    <li>Pointer arithmetic allows you to manipulate the memory addresses stored in pointers, making it possible to traverse arrays and data structures efficiently</li><br>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <h3>File Input/Output</h3>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>C provides functions like fopen to open files, and fclose to close files when you're done with them</li><br>
                    <li>To read from a file, you can use functions like fread and fgets, while fwrite and fprintf are used for writing to files</li><br>
                    <li>C uses file streams to perform file I/O operations, such as reading and writing text or binary data</li><br>
                    <li>The "r" mode is used for reading a file, "w" for writing (creates a new file or overwrites an existing one), and "a" for appending data to a file</li><br>
                    <li>Error handling is important when working with file I/O in C. Functions like feof and ferror can be used to detect errors during file operations</li><br>
                </ul>
