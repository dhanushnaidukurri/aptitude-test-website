            <p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li>Purpose of EDA: EDA is the initial step in data analysis, aimed at summarizing the main characteristics of a dataset, identifying patterns, and detecting anomalies.</li><br>
                    <li>Data Visualization: EDA involves creating visualizations like histograms, box plots, scatter plots, and bar charts to gain insights into data distribution and relationships.</li><br>
                    <li>Descriptive Statistics: Calculate and interpret descriptive statistics such as mean, median, standard deviation, and percentiles to understand the central tendency and spread of the data.</li><br>
                    <li>Outlier Detection: Identify outliers or unusual data points that may require further investigation</li><br>
                    <li>Data Cleaning: EDA often reveals missing data and inconsistencies, leading to data cleaning processes to improve data quality</li><br>

            <h3>Hypothesis Testing:</h3>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Purpose of Hypothesis Testing: Hypothesis testing is used to determine if there is a significant difference or relationship between variables in a dataset.</li><br>
                    <li>Null and Alternative Hypotheses: Formulate null and alternative hypotheses to express the research question being tested.</li><br>
                    <li>Test Statistics: Calculate test statistics (e.g., t-test, chi-squared test) to evaluate whether the observed data provides enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis.</li><br>
                    <li>Significance Levels: Set a significance level (alpha) to determine the threshold for statistical significance.</li><br>
                    <li>Interpretation: Based on the test results, decide whether to accept or reject the null hypothesis and draw conclusions about the research question.</li><br>

                    <li>Coefficients and Predictions: Interpret regression coefficients and use them to make predictions or explain the impact of independent variables on the dependent variable.</li><br>
                    <li>Model Evaluation: Assess the quality of regression models through metrics like R-squared, mean squared error, and root mean squared error.</li><br>
