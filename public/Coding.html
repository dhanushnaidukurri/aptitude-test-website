            <h3>About  Whiteboard Coding: </h3>
            <p>
                Practice coding on a whiteboard or a code editor without the help of an IDE. Also, focus on clarity, step-by-step explanation, and code correctness.

            <h3>About Time Management:</h3>
            <p>
                Work on improving your problem-solving speed. Set time limits for each problem and prioritize efficiency in both code and approach.

            <h3>About Debugging Approaches: </h3>
            <p>
                Using past experience with the software debug the software with similar problems in nature. The success of this approach depends on the expertise of the debugger.<br>
                Cause elimination: it introduces the concept of binary partitioning. Data related to the error occurrence are organized to isolate potential causes.<br>
                Static analysis: Analyzing the code without executing it to identify potential bugs or errors. This approach involves analyzing code syntax, data flow, and control flow.

            <h3>About  Techniques for DP:</h3>
            <p>
                Top-Down(Memoization):
                Break down the given problem in order to begin solving it. If you see that the problem has already been solved, return the saved answer. If it hasnâ€™t been solved, solve it and save it. This is usually easy to think of and very intuitive, This is referred to as Memoization.

                 Bottom-Up(Dynamic Programming):
                Analyze the problem and see in what order the subproblems are solved, and work your way up from the trivial subproblem to the given problem. This process ensures that the subproblems are solved before the main problem. This is referred to as Dynamic Programming.

            <h3>About  Algorithm Design Techniques:</h3>
            <p>
                An algorithm is a step-by-step procedure to solve a problem. A good algorithm should be optimized in terms of time and space. Different types of problems require different types of algorithmic techniques to be solved in the most optimized manner. There are many types of algorithms but the most important and fundamental algorithms that you must are discussed in this article.
