            <h3>About Arrays : </h3>
            <p>
                Array is a sequential arrangement of elements of the same data type, stored in contiguous memory locations. It is an ordered collection that confers constant time access to individual elements and efficient memory usage. Arrays are fundamental for various purposes such as searching, sorting, and storing data, enabling quick and efficient data retrieval.

        <div id="Stacks">
            <h3>About Stacks :</h3>
            <p>
                Stacks are First Out (LIFO) data structures, that follow a specific principle of pushing elements onto the top of the stack and popping elements from the top. Stacks are implemented as linked lists, providing swift and efficient access to the most recently added elements, enabling practical applications such as memory allocation and syntax parsing.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div id="Queues">
            <h3>About Queues : </h3>
            <p>
                Queues follow the First In First Out (FIFO) principle, allowing for the orderly storage and retrieval of elements. Like stacks, they are implemented as linked lists and provide enqueue (adding elements to the back of the queue) and dequeue (removing elements from the front of the queue) operations, making them useful for real-time systems such as operating systems, message passing systems, and web servers.

        </div>
        <div id="LinkedLists">
            <h3>About LinkedLists :</h3>
            <p>
                Linked List is a data structure comprising a sequence of nodes, each containing a reference to the subsequent node in the sequence. Linked lists are vital for dynamic memory allocation and offer primary operations such as insertion, deletion, and traversal. They come in handy when working with variable data sizes, enabling the efficient management of data storage and retrieval.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div id="Trees">
            <h3>About Trees :</h3>
            <p>
                Trees are hierarchical data structures that consist of nodes interconnected by edges. Trees enable the representation of hierarchical relationships such as family trees, and file systems. They also offer searching and sorting operations, making them useful for tasks such as traversing a directory structure, balancing a search tree, and constructing a decision tree.
